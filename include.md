This application allows users to view statistics for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams over the period 1969 - 2000. Users may select 1 or more MLB teams along with one team statistic to explore.


- Data are viewable by MLB franchises that were in existence during that period (for reference, see [MLB Franchise History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Major_League_Baseball)).

- Resultant plots are color coded by general team colors to allow easier inspection of the data. 

- While users may select up to all 30 MLB teams, the plots will become harder to read as more teams are selected. It is recommended that users limit their team selections to 4 or less.

- Data for the entire period is plotted for the selected teams(s), but, in some cases (e.g. Blue Jays, Rockies, Marlins), the team came into existence sometime during 1969 - 2000. In these cases, data will only be plotted for the year the franchise existed.


Data used for the application are associated with the UsingR library of the R programming language [UsingR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UsingR/) available from [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).
